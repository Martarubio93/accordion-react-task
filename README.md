# Callsign Challenge 

## About The Project

This project features a responsive accordion component with data consumed by [Rick & Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character),which returns information on the first 20 characters of the series, by clicking on a row, button checkbox or arrow, the detailed information of each character will be displayed. 
Regarding the layout I have been inspired by the artwork provided by Callsign using the company colour palettes and font type.
